/*
 * Problem 1:
 * We are designing the data collection for the American Kennel Club. 
 * For each dog we need to collect the following information:
 *      - name: to be represented as a String
 *      - breed: of dog
 *      - yob: the year of birth given as a four digit number
 *      - state: of residence â€“ given as the standard two letter abbreviation
 *      - hypoallergenic: a boolean value, true, if the dog is hypoallergenic
 * 
 * Design the class Dog that represents the information about each dog for the census.
 * Make at least three examples of instances of this class, in the class ExamplesDog. 
 * 
 * Two of the examples should be objects named huffle and pearl and should represent the following two dogs:
 *      1. Hufflepuff, a Wheaten Terrier, born in 2012, resides in TX, and is hypoallergenic
 *      2. Pearl, a Labrador Retriever, born in 2016, resides in MA, and is not hypoallergenic
