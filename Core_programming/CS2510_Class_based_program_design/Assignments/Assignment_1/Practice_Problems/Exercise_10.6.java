/*
 * Modify the Coffee class from figure 38 so that cost takes into account bulk discounts:
 * 
 *      Develop a program that computes the cost of selling bulk 
 *      coffee at a specialty coffee seller from a receipt that includes the kind of coffee, 
 *      the unit price, and the total amount (weight) sold. 
 *      If the sale is for less than 5,000 pounds, there is no discount. 
 *      For sales of 5,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds, the seller grants a discount of 10%. 
 *      For sales of 20,000 pounds or more, the discount is 25%. 
 * 
 * Donâ€™t forget to adapt the examples, too.
 *

     | Coffee                      |
     |-----------------------------|

     | int price (cents per pound) |
     | int weight (pounds)         |
     |-----------------------------|
     | int cost()                  |
     | int costWithDiscount()      |   (Modification to add the discount)
     +-----------------------------+
 * Examples:
 *      Coffee type Kona,      at 2095 cents per pound, 100  pounds;   expected cost 209500
 *      Coffee type Ethiopian, at 800  cents per pound, 1000 pounds;   expected cost 800000
 *      Coffee type Colombian, at 950  cents per pound, 20   pounds;   expected cost 19000
