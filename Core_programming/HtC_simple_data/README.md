# Course Review

  
  

**[HowToCode: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data)** is a course that seems pointless until it doesn't.

**[Proof of completion]:**   [My final project](https://github.com/zarry0/cs_curriculum/tree/main/Core_programming/HtC_simple_data/Final-project/README.md)

  <br>

**TL;DR:**  It's a great course, even tho it starts slow, and the topics seem pretty basic, it eventually picks up, and you end up having a much deeper understanding of basic concepts that every course out there aims to explain, but few bother to build intuition for.

<br>
<p>Perhaps it is an issue with the material itself or the way the course is taught (not that the instructor is terrible or anything). Still, it starts slow, which is fine, considering it's a beginner's course.
 But for anyone that has taken a traditional programming course where you learn variables, loops, arrays, functions, etc., it makes you consider why you are going through this at all.

  
  

And suddenly, somewhere in the middle, things start to click, and everything makes sense. Full disclosure here, I pretty much had to take this course twice; the first time, I was annoyed by how easy everything was, and I finished the first five weeks in about five days, trying to get the course out of the way and to move on to the next one as quickly as possible and without really interiorizing the material (since "I already knew all of this"), but at the beginning of week six I felt really burnt-out (reasonably so, after speedrunning the first five weeks), and so, I quit the course and moved on to other stuff.

  
  

After a few months and a few other courses, I decided I should continue with de OSSU CS curriculum, which presented the question: should I start over HtC: Simple Data? or should I pick it up where I left it? Finally, I chose to start over, and oh boy! I chose wisely.

  
  

This time, I left my arrogance aside and decided to take the course as it should be: with an open mind and a willingness to take in the information. And not only did I enjoy the material way more, but I also feel that I managed to build strong intuition for most, if not all, of the concepts covered in the course.

  
  

For instance, I've learned recursion about a dozen times in twice as many courses, books, and tutorials, and I've always seemed to understand the concept, on paper at least. But every time I came across a recursive problem, I had a hard time wrapping my head around the idea; you'll see, while I understand the concept and its elements, I never built the intuition necessary to apply it correctly. Thankfully, one of the main pillars this course is built around is the idea of self-referential data definitions, which lead to, you guessed it, natural recursion. 
And this is what clicked for me in weeks 4 and 5, the idea of trusting natural recursion but not as a leap of faith, not as something that should work because the professor said so, but because there is a logical and intuitive reason for it to do so. I stopped trying to "wrap my head around it." and "blowing my mental stack frame." and now I think I get it; I can still analyze the problem step by step as I did before, but now I can think of the solution recursively and make it have sense in my head without the need to go through the steps.

  

That reason alone makes the course worth it, in my opinion, even when it didn't seem that way at the beginning.

  

## Conclusion.

No matter the level, everyone stands to learn something from this course. For me, the main takeaways are :

- The idea of analyzing the problem and breaking it down into smaller, simpler problems; that can be represented by well-constructed data definitions that can be boiled down to the primitive types offered by the language.

- The idea of natural recursion is a consequence of self-referential data and a way to understand it intuitively.

- The practice of dividing a function (and a problem, for that matter) into its primordial elements and handling each task individually, knowing that as long as the signatures (input/output types) keep consistent and each part works correctly, the sum of all the elements should work as well.
